## Week 1: Basics of Java

### Topics Covered
1. **Identifiers, Literals, and Variables**
   - Understanding identifiers, literals, and variables.
   - Data types in Java (`int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`).
2. **If-Else Constructs**
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, `nested if-else`).
3. **Loop Constructs**
   - Looping paradigms (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `for-each`).
4. **Switch-Case**
   - Using `switch-case` for decision-making.

### Practice Questions

#### 1. Identifiers, Literals, and Variables
1. Write a program to declare variables of different data types (`int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`) and print their values.
2. Swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.
3. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle given the radius.

#### 2. If-Else Constructs
1. Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using nested `if-else`.
3. Write a program to determine the grade of a student based on their marks (A, B, C, D, F).

#### 3. Loop Constructs
1. Write a program to print the first 10 natural numbers using a `for` loop.
2. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a `while` loop.
3. Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to a given number.

#### 4. Switch-Case
1. Write a program that takes a number (1-7) as input and prints the corresponding day of the week.
2. Write a program to perform basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) using a `switch-case` statement.
3. Write a program to check if a given character is a vowel or consonant using a `switch-case`.
